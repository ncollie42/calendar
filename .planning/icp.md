# Ideal Customer Profile

## Core Insight

This is not a calendar app. It's a **life density visualizer for couples**.

Empty weeks are dark. A date night adds a warm color. A weekend trip adds a bright one. A big vacation is a burst. You open it and either feel good ("look at all that color") or feel the nudge ("next month is looking empty").

The pitch: **"Watch your year light up."**

## Primary Customer: The Couple Auditor

The planner in a couple who looks at the calendar and feels the gap between how they're living and how they want to live.

### Who they are
- Couples, likely late 20s-40s, dual income
- No kids yet or young kids
- One partner is the "planner" — that's the actual user
- Value experiences over things
- Intentional about their relationship but life keeps defaulting to routine

### What they believe
- A good life is a full life (not busy — *full*)
- If we don't plan it, it won't happen
- We have the money and time for fun, we just don't act on it

### The trigger moment
Sunday evening. The week ahead is blank. Or worse — looking back and realizing a whole month slipped by with nothing but work and Netflix.

### Their emotional cycle (the one we break)
1. **Guilt** — "We haven't done anything in weeks"
2. **Intent** — "Let's plan something this weekend"
3. **Friction** — Searching Yelp, texting back and forth, nothing locks in
4. **Default** — Netflix again
5. **Repeat**

The app breaks this by making emptiness visible *before* guilt kicks in, and making it easy to fill.

### What success looks like to them
- Not "I have 5 events on my calendar"
- But "I can look at my year and feel good about how we're living"
- The year lights up with color — different sized events, a mix of small and big
- No empty stretches. Balance between date nights and bigger things.

### Peak motivation windows
- Sunday evening (planning the week)
- January / New Year (annual intentions)
- After a great trip or date ("we should do this more")
- After a boring stretch ("we need to fix this")

### Current hacks (what they do today without us)
- Shared Google Calendar with vague aspirational events
- Running note in Apple Notes with "things to do"
- Group chat: "we should try that place"
- Nothing — they just feel guilty periodically

### The partner asymmetry problem
One partner plans, the other goes along. The app must work even if only ONE person uses it actively. The passive partner's experience: see what's planned, say yes/no, show up.

## Adjacent Personas

### The Season Planner
Same person as the Couple Auditor, zoomed out. Thinks in quarters — summer plans, holiday season, ski trip window. Anchors the big things first (anniversary trip, summer vacation, holidays), then the app shows the gaps between them. This is the **power user** mode.

### The FOMO Avoider
The passive partner, or a friend in the orbit. Doesn't plan, but wants to see what's happening. Opens the app to check "oh, she put something down for Saturday — nice." Read-only. Reactive. But their presence is what makes the planner feel like they're not planning alone. **This is the growth engine** — they don't create content, but they're the reason others do.

### The Momentum Keeper
A friend group where someone said "let's do something next weekend" and it's about to die in the group chat. They need to capture intent before enthusiasm fades. The couple's social circle — "we're free next weekend" becomes visible to other couples who might join.

### The Social Architect
Someone who genuinely loves organizing. Already has 4 ideas, just needs to slot them in. Likely already well-served by existing tools — not our primary target, but they'll find us and be happy.

## Business Channel: Latent Design Play

### The idea
Local businesses (yoga studios, climbing gyms, bars with trivia night, cooking classes) add their recurring events to a public, view-only calendar. A QR code at the front desk or on a flyer links to it. Customers scan, see the schedule, and now they're inside the ecosystem.

### Why this matters
- **For the business**: Low-cost digital presence. No app to build. Their events just exist on a shareable calendar. Better than an Instagram story that disappears.
- **For the customer**: They scanned to see class times. Now they see a calendar interface. The adjacent idea lands: "I could use this for my own life."
- **Latent design**: The business calendar is the trojan horse. The person came for spin class times. They leave thinking about their empty weekends.

### How it connects to the core ICP
The Couple Auditor's empty week gets filled with *discoverable things*. A yoga studio's schedule isn't just logistics — it's a suggestion. "We could do that Tuesday class together." The business calendar becomes content that feeds the life-density visualizer.

### The loop
1. Business posts public calendar (free, QR code)
2. Person scans, sees schedule
3. Person sees the app, thinks "this is nice"
4. Person starts their own calendar
5. Person subscribes to the business calendar to fill their weeks
6. Business gets recurring visibility without ad spend

## What We Are Not

- Not a logistics tool (Cozi, FamCal — managing kid pickups)
- Not a scheduling tool (Calendly, When2meet — finding mutual availability)
- Not a social network (Facebook Events — discovery-first, planning-second)
- Not a project manager (Notion, Trello — task tracking)

We are the space between "we should do something" and "look at the year we had."

## Open Questions

- **What's "enough"?** When is a year well packed? Is 1 thing per week enough? Does a big trip offset 3 empty weeks? Should couples define their own rhythm, or should the visual density speak for itself?
- **Passive partner engagement**: How do we keep the non-planner engaged without requiring them to use the app daily? Push notification? Weekly text summary?
- **Business calendar moderation**: If businesses can post, how do we keep quality high and prevent it from feeling like an ad platform?
- **Single vs. couple**: Can a single person use this for themselves? The "life density" concept doesn't require a partner. But the emotional hook is strongest for couples. Do we narrow or stay open?

## Marketing Campaigns — First Users

### 1. Content-Led: "Empty Calendar" Provocation
Write short, visual content that triggers the Sunday evening guilt moment. Posts like "Your last 3 months, visualized" with a mostly-dark heatmap vs. a colorful one. Platforms: Instagram Reels, TikTok, Reddit (r/relationships, r/datingoverthirty). Cost: time only. Tests messaging before product.

### 2. Couples Newsletter / Community Infiltration
Find where the Couple Auditor already hangs out — couples podcasts, relationship subreddits, "date night idea" Instagram accounts. Partner with or sponsor a few. Pitch: "Stop scrolling for date ideas. See your whole year."

### 3. Local Business QR Code Pilot
Pick 5-10 local businesses (yoga studio, climbing gym, cocktail bar) and offer them a free public calendar page with a QR code. Their customers scan it, see the interface, and get the "I could use this" moment. This is the trojan horse from the business channel section — test it early even if scrappy.

### 4. "Relationship Resolution" Seasonal Launch
Time a push around peak motivation windows — January ("new year, better us"), Valentine's Day ("don't just do one night"), or summer planning season. Create a "2026 Life Density Challenge" — couples sign up, fill their year, share progress. Leverages the annual intention energy.

### 5. Waitlist + Referral With Visual Hook
Landing page showing a sample year visualization — one empty, one full of color. "Watch your year light up." Email capture with referral mechanic: "Get early access faster by inviting another couple." Couples naturally come in pairs, so referral is built into the use case.

### 6. Partner Asymmetry as a Feature
Market directly to the planner: "You're already the one who plans everything. Now you have proof." The passive partner doesn't need to download anything — they get a shared link. Removes the "I can't get my partner to use another app" objection. Share token architecture already supports this.

### Recommended Priority
1. **Start with 1 + 5 together** — Content that triggers the emotional moment, pointing to a waitlist with the visual hook. Tests whether the "life density" framing resonates before investing in partnerships or paid channels.
2. **Layer in 3** (local business QR) once the experience is polished enough for "I just scanned this randomly" users.
3. **Core question to answer first**: Does the "empty calendar = guilt" framing actually make people act? Everything else follows from that.
