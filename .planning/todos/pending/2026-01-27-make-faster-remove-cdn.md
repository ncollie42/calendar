title: Make Faster - Remove CDN Dependencies
area: general
files: []

## Problem

Application may be loading slowly due to CDN dependencies. External CDN requests add latency and create single points of failure. Bundling dependencies locally could improve load time and reliability.

## Solution

TBD - Investigate current CDN usage and evaluate bundling dependencies locally instead.
