title: Use Sub Agents for Waves Implementation
area: planning
files: []
---

## Problem

When implementing features in "waves" (parallel work streams), context can become overwhelming for a single agent. Sub agents could handle individual waves with focused context, reducing cognitive load and improving implementation quality.

## Solution

TBD - Explore using Claude Code's Task tool with specialized sub agents for parallel implementation waves. Each sub agent gets relevant context for their specific wave, then results are coordinated.
