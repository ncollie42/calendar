I'm facing this problem: $ARGUMENTS

I don't know what I don't know here. I need you to fill in my blind spots.

## Your Task

Research how **top experts** - the best in the game - would approach this problem. Not how a junior dev would Google their way through it, but how someone who's solved this a hundred times would think about it.

## Step 1: Understand My Situation

First, ask me 2-3 clarifying questions about:
- What I'm actually trying to achieve (the real goal, not just the task)
- What constraints I'm working with
- What I've already tried or considered

## Step 2: Surface What I Don't Know

Identify the **unknown unknowns** - things I probably haven't considered:
- Industry-standard approaches I might not be aware of
- Common pitfalls that catch people new to this
- Architectural patterns that experts use by default
- Trade-offs I might not realize exist

## Step 3: How the Pros Do It

Research and explain:
1. **The "obvious" solution** - What most people do, and why it's often wrong
2. **The expert approach** - What battle-tested practitioners actually do
3. **Why the difference matters** - Real consequences of getting this wrong

Include specific techniques, patterns, or tools that experts reach for.

## Step 4: Actionable Recommendations

Give me:
1. **The approach I should take** - Concrete steps, not abstract advice
2. **What to avoid** - Specific anti-patterns for this problem
3. **How to tell if I'm on track** - Signs I'm doing it right vs. going off the rails

## Research Sources

Use web search to find:
- How FAANG/top-tier companies solve this
- Conference talks or blog posts from recognized experts
- Battle-tested open source implementations
- Post-mortems from when this went wrong

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

### The Problem (as experts see it)
[Reframe the problem from an expert's perspective - often different from how beginners frame it]

### What Most People Get Wrong
[Common mistakes and misconceptions]

### The Expert Playbook
[How top practitioners actually approach this]

### Your Next Steps
[Specific, actionable recommendations for my situation]

### Further Reading
[2-3 high-quality resources if I want to go deeper]

Be direct. If there's a clearly superior approach, say so. Don't hedge with "it depends" unless it actually does - and if it does, tell me what it depends on.
