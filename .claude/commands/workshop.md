Let's workshop this spec addition: $ARGUMENTS

Can you spot what's not clear in the PRD? How can we update it so it's clear for future implementations?

Include the relevant spec file(s) using @ syntax (e.g., `@specs/backend.md`).

Available specs:
- `specs/frontend.md` - Frontend design specification
- `specs/backend.md` - Backend server specification

Before drafting the update:
1. Ask me clarifying questions about the unclear areas you've identified
2. Point out any ambiguities, missing details, or potential implementation confusion
3. Suggest specific improvements once we've discussed

Focus on making the spec precise enough that future implementations won't require additional context or interpretation.
