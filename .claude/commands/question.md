Read the plan file and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool about literally anything related to this plan: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, architecture decisions, edge cases, error handling, performance considerations, user workflows, data models, API design, security implications, testing strategies, deployment considerations, and any other aspects that need clarification before implementation.

Be thorough and ask probing follow-up questions. Don't assume anything - if something is ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask about it.
